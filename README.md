# Blackjack, line by line
A simple blackjack game coded in 2017 for a class at Rhodes College.

This lab was introduced as the first lab in a data structures and algorithms course to 
refresh the idea of object-oriented programming for students. Rules, dealer strategy, and 
file dependencies were defined in the lab assignment, while algorithms and data structures 
were left to the student's discretion.
